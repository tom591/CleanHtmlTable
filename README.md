## 🧰 What is it?
📝 The live demo is available in **Czech** at the link above.

**CleanHtmlTable** is a Flask-based web application designed to clean HTML code by removing unwanted styles and unnecessary elements.

---

## ⚡ Quick Demo of Simplicity

This project is a minimal demonstration of what Flask can do — the core logic fits in just **40 lines of Python**  
(and could be even shorter 😄).

---

## 🛠️ About the App

A small and simple **Flask (Python)** web app built to sanitize styled HTML tables.  
It strips away unwanted attributes and inline styles — some of which can be re-enabled via checkboxes.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Only **three modules** are needed:

- `Flask` – web framework  
- `beautifulsoup4` – HTML parsing and cleaning  
- `Flask-WTF` – used only for basic CSRF protection ([Flask-WTF docs](https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io))

---

## 🎨 Frontend

The template uses CSS styles imported from **[w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/)** —  
meaning it’ll survive even the end of the world 😄  
Inline styles ensure basic mobile responsiveness.
